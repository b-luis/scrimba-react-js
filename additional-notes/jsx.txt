JSX
 - JavaScript & XML
 - HTML inside JS
 - produces React 'elements'

Ex. 

ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
        <h1 className="header">This is JSX</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </div>,
    document.getElementById("root")
) 

Note: must have a parent element if there are more than two child elements. 
      (reason why the <div></div> element was indluded above.)

Additionally, these HTML elements can be put inside a variable.
Generally, it might look like absurd, but for better code readability, 
adding parenthesis and indenting it, makes it better.

Ex. 

const page = (
    <div>
        <h1 className="header">This is JSX</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </div>
)

ReactDOM.render(
    page,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
