3. When does React run your useEffect function? When does it NOT run
   the effect function?
Scrimba's answer: 
- as soon as the component loads
- by default ,if there's no dependency array, it'll run the effect every render   
- will not run if there's a dependency array

- As soon as the component loads (first render)
- On every re-render of the component (assuming no dependencies array)
- Will NOT run the effect when the values of the dependencies in the
  array stay the same between renders

Scrimba's answer:
- second parameter to the useEffect function
